# Contributing

Welcome! This is a repository I've put together with resources that have helped me learn R from Excel. I hope that it will grow over time, and I'd love for other people to help make it the best it can be. I want to be accessible to the broader community and cognizant of different learning styles, and I'm hoping you can help with that! 

## Want to contribute?

There are two ways you can contribute to this repository:

1. Submit a pull request.

In your pull request, please add your content around the existing content. I likely won't accept a pull request that deletes something I've already written. Also, add a short note about why you think this content should be included! 

[How do I submit a pull request?](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

2. Add an issue.

If you're not sure how to submit a pull request or just want to suggest a more general thing (e.g. a new organization strategy), issues are a great way to do that! If you're submitting a new section or piece of content, add a link and a short bit about how it's helped you. If you're suggesting something broader, I'd love to hear your thoughts! 

## What can I contribute?

* Links! I'm especially looking for links to relevant courses and tutorials. 

* Code snippets. 
  * Learn something cool? Find a shortcut? Leave lots of comments so I can follow your thought process and post it here! Either find a section you think it goes in or create a new one. 
  
* Something helpful I haven't thought of? Let me know!
